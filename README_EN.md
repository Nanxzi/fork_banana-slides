## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: your presentation is due tomorrow, but your slides are still blank? You have countless brilliant ideas in your head, but your passion is drained by the tedious tasks of layout and design.

We all long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult.
- 3️⃣ Similar visual outcomes with heavy homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack relevance to the specific topic.
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text-and-image layout with poor design aesthetic.

These deficiencies make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our dual requirements for "speed" and "aesthetics." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPTs" are, in my eyes, still far from being truly "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana 🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro to generate PPT pages and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can accurately render almost all the text requested in the prompts while strictly following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate aesthetic PPTs with zero threshold and no design experience required, reducing the hassle of choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and graphic elements to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete presentation assignments, focusing energy on content rather than typesetting and beautification.
5. **Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions, with rapid adaptation to multiple scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly produce beautiful and professional presentations.</b>
</p>

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Flexible and Diverse Creation Paths

Supports three starting modes: **Ideas**, **Outlines**, and **Page Descriptions**, catering to different creative habits.
- **One-Sentence Generation**: Enter a topic, and AI automatically generates a well-structured outline and page-by-page content descriptions.
- **Natural Language Editing**: Supports modifying outlines or descriptions via natural language prompts (e.g., "Change page three to a case study"), with AI responding and adjusting in real-time.
- **Outline/Description Mode**: Supports both one-click batch generation and manual detail adjustments.
- **Reliable Markdown Import**: The import pop-up previews the number of identifiable pages before execution, preventing confusion about successful additions if formatting issues occur.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fc1ecc6-433d-4157-b4ca-95fcebac66ba" />

### 2. Powerful Resource Parsing Capabilities

- **Multi-format Support**: Upload PDF, Docx, MD, Txt, and other files for automatic background content parsing.
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Automatically identify key points, image links, and chart information from the text, providing rich materials for generation.
- **Automatic Image Storage**: Images extracted from documents will be automatically added to the project material library once the reference file is associated with the project, allowing for direct reuse in the future.
- **Style Reference**: Supports uploading reference images or templates to customize PPT styles.

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Document Parsing and Material Processing" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cda1fd2-2369-4028-b310-ea6604183936" />

### 3. "Vibe" Style Natural Language Modification

No longer limited by complex menus and buttons, directly issue editing commands through **natural language**.
- **Local Edit**: Perform verbal modifications on unsatisfactory areas (e.g., "Change this chart to a pie chart").
- **Full-page Optimization**: Generate high-definition, stylistically consistent pages based on nano banana pro🍌.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/929ba24a-996c-4f6d-9ec6-818be6b08ea3" />

### 4. Out-of-the-box Format Export

- **Multi-format Support**: One-click export to standard **PPTX** or **PDF** files.
- **Playback Settings**: Enable slide transitions before exporting to PPTX. Supports classic effects such as Fade, Push, Pan, Wipe, Split, Blinds, Checkerboard, and Clock, with the ability to multi-select for random application.
- **Export File Management**: The preview page lists all files exported on the server, allowing you to download them directly or delete those no longer needed. Export task history is isolated by project to prevent accidental deletion of records from other projects. If a backend task is no longer available after a refresh, the task panel will clearly display a failure and prompt a re-export.
- **Clearer Page-Selective Export**: The page-selective export now indicates the status of missing images within the current selection range. Unselected draft pages will no longer cause the export entry for selected completed pages to be greyed out. Explainer videos will only include pages without images if the placeholder frame option is explicitly checked.
- **Perfect Fit**: Default 16:9 aspect ratio; layout requires no manual adjustments and is ready for direct presentation.

**Use the new editable export configuration method to get better editable export results**: You need to obtain an API KEY from the [Baidu AI Cloud Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/iam/#/iam/apikey/list) (click here to enter) and fill it in the `BAIDU_API_KEY` field in the `.env` file (there is a sufficient free quota). See the instructions in https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121 for details.


<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (for GCP users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models via GCP service accounts; new users can use free credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account and download the key file in JSON format.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml` to mount the key file into the container and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`

</details>

2. **Start the Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip local build steps for fast deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Image (No need to build from scratch)

docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After starting, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application. The app will determine if an update is available based on the current version SHA; when running from source, the current Git SHA will also be used for this check.

**Build Images from Scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```

3. **Accessing the Application**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3011
- Backend API: http://localhost:5011

4. **View Logs**

```bash
```

# View Backend Logs (Last 200 Lines)

docker logs --tail 200 banana-slides-backend

# View Backend Logs in Real-time (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs -f --tail 100 banana-slides-backend

# View Frontend Logs (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs --tail 100 banana-slides-frontend
```

5. **Stop Services**

```bash
docker compose down
```

6. **Update Project**

**Using Pre-built Images (docker-compose.prod.yml)**

Alternatively, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application to see if a new version is available.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Using Local Build (docker-compose.yml)**

Note: If you have manually modified the code, this method is not applicable. You must first revert the code to the version at the time of the last pull.

```bash
git pull 
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Deploy from Source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for explanation video export, and must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when uploading PPTX files using the "PPT Remake" feature to convert PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading.** Reason: LibreOffice may cause layout displacement during server-side rendering due to missing fonts (e.g., Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore some special effects. Uploading PDF files does not require LibreOffice. Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container can execute:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost after the container is rebuilt and must be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the code repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run in the project root directory:
```bash

# macOS (Homebrew)

brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full

# Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9

# Then install Python dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies according to `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure environment variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

# Then, follow the previously mentioned method to open and edit the `.env` file and configure your API key.

# This is a Level 2 Heading

This is a paragraph.

</div>

#### Frontend Installation

1. **Enter the frontend directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure API address**

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service specified by `BACKEND_PORT` via Vite proxy (default `http://localhost:5011`). To modify this, please set `BACKEND_PORT` in the `.env` file at the project root.

#### Start the Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`
> Note: Under the default configuration, templates, assets, and outputs are all located in the `uploads/` folder.

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5011`.

Visit `http://localhost:5011/health` to verify if the service is running correctly.

#### Start the Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3011`.

Open your browser to access and use the application.
