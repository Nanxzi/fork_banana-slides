## 🔥 Latest Updates

- **[2026-07-15]**: Custom outline/description requirement presets now automatically repair corrupted browser cache, retaining valid presets to prevent abnormal cache issues from blocking the editing page.
- **[2026-07-11]**: 0.9.0 Release Candidate 2 released, including all capabilities of RC1 and fixing inconsistent MinerU directories for editable PPTX on Windows desktop, as well as incorrect FFprobe paths for explanation videos; [One-click download and install](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/releases/tag/v0.9.0-rc.2)
- **[2026-06-23]**: Page-by-page templates launched — supporting both unified template and independent per-page template modes. Users can upload images or PDFs to build a project template library; AI automatically parses template styles for one-click intelligent matching per page, or manual binding per page; both modes can be switched bi-directionally at any time ([Documentation](https://docs.bananaslides.online/zh/features/templates))
- **[2026-04-25]**: Asset Toolbox launched — adding three new modes: full-image editing, region editing (overlay/replace), and smart erase on top of existing asset generation, with a unified entry point for one-stop operation.
- **[2026-04-25]**: Support for account binding via official OpenAI OAuth. Once bound, Codex can be used directly as a text/image generation provider without manually entering an API Key. Plus accounts can generate 100+ 2k images every five hours ([Tutorial](https://ziy68cvfvu3.feishu.cn/wiki/LDSOwPzkhiNonkkNTF1ct2VBnNc)) (Based on official OpenAI OAuth PKCE authorization flow, not reverse engineering).
- **[2026-04-25]**: Support for saving custom text style description templates, which can be named, color-coded, and persistently reused without re-entering every time.
- **[2026-04-23]**: Support for gpt-image-2 model. Editable background export quality has also improved due to upgraded model capabilities (Select "Generative Retrieval" in Settings - Export Options - Background Retrieval).
- **[2026-04-11]**: Supported [CLI operations and added agent skills](https://docs.bananaslides.online/cli).
- **[2026-03]**: Added several features and optimizations, such as extra fields, multi-ratio settings, etc.
- **[2026-02-09]**: New Features and Optimizations
  * New Features
    * Support for pasting and immediate recognition of images in Home, Outline, and Description cards, providing a better interaction experience.
    * Manual outline chapter editing: Support for manually adjusting the chapter (part) a page belongs to.
    * Docker Multi-architecture: Image supports amd64 / arm64 builds.
    * Internationalization + Dark Mode: Added Chinese/English switching; supports Light/Dark/Follow System themes; all components adapted for Dark Mode.
  * Fixes and Experience Optimizations
    * Fixed export-related 500 errors, reference file association timing, outline/page data misalignment, task polling for incorrect projects, infinite polling for description generation, image preview memory leaks, and partial failure handling in batch deletions.
    * Optimized format example hints, HTTP error message copy, Modal closing experience, cleaned up old project localStorage, and removed redundant hints for first-time project creation.
    * Various other optimizations and fixes.

> **Desktop Version Configuration, Storage, and Export Tips**: The desktop installer does not have a `.env` in the project root; please save API configurations directly in "Settings". Upon first installation on Windows, you can choose the "Data Storage Location"; all desktop platforms can also modify this in "Settings → Data Storage Location", which takes effect after a restart. The application will not automatically migrate or delete old data; before manual migration, the application must be completely exited from the system tray, and the three directories `data`, `uploads`, and `exports` must be copied in their entirety. The desktop version completes OpenAI OAuth in the system browser and automatically displays as connected after a successful callback without refreshing the app. Desktop exports will trigger a system save dialog and will only be considered complete after the file is successfully written to the selected location; if writing fails, the target path and error message will be displayed, and you can also redownload from the "Export Tasks" panel.

## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this dilemma: a presentation is due tomorrow, but your PPT is still a blank slate; your mind is filled with brilliant ideas, but your passion is drained by tedious typesetting and design?

We (I) long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates, unable to flexibly adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making iterative changes difficult 
- 3️⃣ Similar visual outcomes with severe homogenization
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets lacking specificity
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text-image layouts with poor design aesthetics

These shortcomings make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy the two core requirements of PPT creation: "speed" and "aesthetics." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are still far from being truly "Vibe" in my eyes.

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro for PPT page generation and found the results to be excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. Moreover, it can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompts while following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero barrier to entry; no design experience required; reduces the hassle of choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and graphic combinations to quickly find design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly convert teaching materials into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom impact.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete assignment presentations, focusing efforts on content rather than formatting and beautification.
5. **Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions with quick adaptation for various scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly produce aesthetically pleasing and professional presentations</b>
</p>

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Flexible and Diverse Creative Paths

Supports three starting modes—**Idea**, **Outline**, and **Page Description**—to cater to different creative habits.
- **One-Sentence Generation**: Input a topic, and the AI automatically generates a clearly structured outline and page-by-page content descriptions.
- **Natural Language Editing**: Supports modifying the outline or descriptions using natural language via "Vibe" (e.g., "Change page three to a case study"); the AI responds and adjusts in real-time.
- **Outline/Description Mode**: Supports both one-click batch generation and manual adjustment of details.
- **More Reliable Markdown Import**: The import popup provides a preview of recognized pages before execution and appends pages all at once based on the file order, avoiding formatting issues or uncertain page sequences after multi-page imports.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fc1ecc6-433d-4157-b4ca-95fcebac66ba" />

### 2. Powerful Asset Parsing Capability

- **Multi-format Support**: Upload PDF/Docx/MD/Txt and other file types; the system automatically parses content in the background.
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Automatically identifies key points, image links, and chart information within the text, providing rich source material for generation.
- **Automatic Image Archiving**: Images extracted from documents are automatically added to the project's asset library once the reference file is associated with the project, allowing for direct reuse later.
- **Style Reference**: Supports uploading reference images or templates to customize the PPT style.
- **Multi-Image Joint Reference**: When using GPT Image, the image template and the assets in the page description are passed to the model together, rather than relying solely on the first reference image.

### 3. "Vibe"-style Natural Language Modification

No longer limited by complex menu buttons, issue modification commands directly through **natural language**.
- **Inpainting (Partial Redrawing)**: Make verbal-style modifications to unsatisfactory areas (e.g., "Change this chart to a pie chart").
- **Full-Page Optimization**: Generate high-definition, stylistically consistent pages based on nano banana pro🍌.
- **Quality Control Mode**: Can be enabled in system settings or on the preview page. It automatically checks for garbled text, low-quality visuals, and prompt deviation after generation; only images that pass the check are saved as new versions.
- **Page Properties Panel**: A draggable properties drawer can be pulled from the right edge of the preview page. Edit titles, chapters, page descriptions (supports pasting images and additional description fields), page-level templates, and narration scripts while viewing the page. It saves automatically once you stop typing, eliminating the need to repeatedly open and close pop-up windows.

### 4. Out-of-the-box Format Export

- **Multi-format Support**: One-click export to standard **PPTX** or **PDF** files.
- **Playback Settings**: Enable slide transition animations before exporting to PPTX. Supports classic effects such as Fade, Push, Wipe, Split, Blinds, Checkerboard, Clock, and more, with the option to select multiple for random application.
- **Export File Management**: The preview page lists exported files on the server, allowing for direct download or deletion of unnecessary files. Export task history is isolated by project to prevent accidental deletion of other project records. If a backend task becomes unavailable after refreshing, the task panel will clearly display a failure and prompt for a re-export.
- **Video Export Configuration Pre-check**: Displays the loading status of settings before opening the narration video panel. If the output language or ElevenLabs configuration fails to load, a clear retry prompt will be shown, preventing the system from proceeding with uncertain default values.
- **Clearer Page Selection for Export**: The page selection export feature now indicates missing image status based on the current selection range. Unselected draft pages will no longer grey out the export entry for selected completed pages. Narration videos will only include pages without images if the placeholder frame option is explicitly checked.
- **Perfect Fit**: Default 16:9 aspect ratio ensures the layout is ready for direct presentation without any secondary adjustments.

### 5. Fully editable PPTX export (Beta iteration)

- **Export images as high-fidelity, clean-background PPT slides with freely editable images and text**
- See related updates at https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121
<img width="1000"  alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a85d2d48-1966-4800-a4bf-73d17f914062" />

### 6. One-click Export of Explanation Videos

- **One-click conversion of slides into presentation videos with AI voiceover and subtitles (MP4)**
- AI automatically generates natural spoken narration based on page descriptions and content
- Supports configuration of multiple expression styles, languages, and voices

<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (for GCP users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models via GCP service accounts; new users can use free credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON format key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If using Docker for deployment, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml`, mount the key file into the container, and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

2. **Start Service**

**⚡ Use Prebuilt Images (Recommended)**

The project provides prebuilt frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip local build steps for rapid deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Images (No Need to Build from Scratch)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After starting, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the app. The application will determine if an update is available based on the current version SHA; when running from source, the current Git SHA will also be used for determination.

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configuration in the `.env` file and then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```


3. **Accessing the Application**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3011
- Backend API: http://localhost:5011

4. **View Logs**

```bash
```

# View Backend Logs (Last 200 Lines)

docker logs --tail 200 banana-slides-backend

# Real-time Monitoring of Backend Logs (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs -f --tail 100 banana-slides-backend

# View Frontend Logs (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs --tail 100 banana-slides-frontend
```

5. **Stop Services**

```bash
docker compose down
```

6. **Update Project**

**Using Pre-built Images (docker-compose.prod.yml)**

You can also go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application to see if a new version is available.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Using Local Build (docker-compose.yml)**

Note: If the code has been manually modified, this method is not applicable. You need to revert the code to the version it was when pulled.

```bash
git pull 
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Deploy from Source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for narrated video export, and must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required for converting PPTX files to PDF when using the "PPT Refurbish" feature. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading** because LibreOffice may cause layout misalignment during server-side rendering due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore some special effects. LibreOffice is not required if you upload PDF files directly. Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container can run:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost after the container is rebuilt and will need to be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run the following in the project root directory:
```bash
```

# macOS (Homebrew)

brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full

# Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9

# Then install Python dependencies

uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

#### Frontend Installation

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure API address**

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service specified by `BACKEND_PORT` via Vite proxy (defaulting to `http://localhost:5011`). If you need to modify this, please set `BACKEND_PORT` in the `.env` file at the project root.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`
> Note: Under the default configuration, templates, assets, and final products are all located in the `uploads/` folder.

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5011`.

Visit `http://localhost:5011/health` to verify that the service is running correctly.

#### Start Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3011`.

Open your browser and visit the address to use the application.
