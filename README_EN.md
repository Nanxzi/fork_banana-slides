## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: a presentation is due tomorrow, but your slides are still blank; your mind is full of brilliant ideas, but all your enthusiasm is drained by tedious typesetting and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the "speed" requirement, they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates with no flexibility to adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult 
- 3️⃣ Finished products look similar, with severe homogenization
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack relevance
- 5️⃣ Fragmented layout of text and images, resulting in poor design quality

These deficiencies make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously meet our dual needs of "speed" and "aesthetics." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, far from having enough "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana 🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro to generate PPT pages and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. Furthermore, it can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompts while following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Zero barrier to quickly generating aesthetic PPTs without design experience, reducing the hassle of template selection.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and visual elements to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated PPT lesson plans to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete presentation assignments, focusing energy on content rather than layout and aesthetics.
5. **Workplace Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions with fast adaptation to various scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly create aesthetic and professional presentations</b>
</p>

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Flexible and Versatile Creation Paths

Supports three starting modes: **Idea**, **Outline**, and **Page Description** to suit different creative habits.
- **One-sentence Generation**: Enter a topic, and the AI will automatically generate a clearly structured outline and page-by-page content descriptions.
- **Natural Language Editing**: Supports modifying the outline or description via "Vibe" prompts (e.g., "change the third page to a case study"), with the AI adjusting in real-time.
- **Outline/Description Mode**: Allows for both one-click batch generation and manual fine-tuning of details.
- **Reliable Markdown Import**: The import dialog previews the number of recognizable pages before execution and appends pages all at once in file order, preventing formatting issues or sequence uncertainty when importing multiple pages.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fc1ecc6-433d-4157-b4ca-95fcebac66ba" />

### 2. Powerful Asset Parsing Capabilities

- **Multi-format Support**: Upload PDF/Docx/MD/Txt and other files, and the background will automatically parse the content.
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Automatically identify key points, image links, and chart information in the text to provide rich materials for generation.
- **Automatic Image Archiving**: Images parsed from documents will automatically enter the project asset library after the reference file is associated with the project, allowing for direct reuse later.
- **Style Reference**: Supports uploading reference images or templates to customize the PPT style.

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="文件解析与素材处理" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cda1fd2-2369-4028-b310-ea6604183936" />

### 3. "Vibe"-style Natural Language Modification

No longer restricted by complex menu buttons, issue modification commands directly using **natural language**.
- **Inpainting**: Make verbal-style modifications to unsatisfactory areas (e.g., "Change this chart to a pie chart").
- **Full-Page Optimization**: Generate high-definition, stylistically consistent pages based on nano banana pro🍌.
- **Quality Control Mode**: Can be enabled in system settings or the preview page; it automatically checks for garbled text, low-quality visuals, and prompt deviation after generation. Only images that pass the inspection will be saved as new versions.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/929ba24a-996c-4f6d-9ec6-818be6b08ea3" />

### 4. Out-of-the-box Format Export

- **Multi-format Support**: One-click export to standard **PPTX** or **PDF** files.
- **Playback Settings**: Enable slide transition animations before exporting to PPTX. Supports classic effects such as Fade, Push, Pan, Wipe, Split, Blinds, Checkerboard, Clock, etc., with the option to randomly apply multiple selected effects.
- **Export File Management**: The preview page lists files already exported on the server, allowing for direct download or deletion of unnecessary files. Export task history is isolated and cleared by project to avoid accidental deletion of records from other projects. If a backend task becomes unavailable after refreshing, the task panel will clearly display a failure status and prompt for re-export.
- **Clearer Page Selection Export**: The selective page export now indicates missing image status based on the current selection range. Unselected draft pages will no longer gray out the export entry for selected completed pages. Explainer videos will only include pages without images if the placeholder frame option is explicitly checked.
- **Perfect Adaptation**: Default 16:9 aspect ratio requires no secondary layout adjustments; ready for direct presentation.

### 6. One-Click Explainer Video Export

- **One-click conversion of slides into explainer videos (MP4) with AI voiceovers and subtitles**
- AI automatically generates conversational narration based on page descriptions and content
- Supports configuration of multiple expression styles, languages, and voice tones

**Use the new editable export configuration method to achieve better editable export results**: You need to obtain an API KEY from the [Baidu AI Cloud Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/iam/#/iam/apikey/list) (click here to enter) and fill it in the `BAIDU_API_KEY` field in the `.env` file (sufficient free quota is available). See the instructions in https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121 for details.


<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (For GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models via a GCP service account; new users can use free credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON format key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment relevant lines in `docker-compose.yml`, mount the key file into the container, and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

2. **Start the Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip local build steps for rapid deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Images (No need to build from scratch)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After startup, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application. The app will determine if an update is available based on the current version SHA; when running from source, the current Git SHA will also be used for determination.

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```

### Deploy from Source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for exporting presentation videos; must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required for converting PPTX files to PDF when using the "PPT Revamp" feature with PPTX uploads. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading.** Reason: Server-side rendering with LibreOffice may result in layout misalignment due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully reproduce some special effects. LibreOffice is not required if uploading PDF files. Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container can run:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed via this method will be lost after the container is rebuilt and will need to be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run the following command in the project root directory:
```bash

# macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full
```

# Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9

# Then Install Python Dependencies

uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

# Then, as described earlier, open and edit the `.env` file to configure your API key

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service specified by `BACKEND_PORT` (default `http://localhost:5011`) via Vite proxy. To modify this, please set `BACKEND_PORT` in the `.env` file at the project root.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`  
> Note: Under default configuration, templates, assets, and final products are all stored in the `uploads/` folder.

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5011`.

Visit `http://localhost:5011/health` to verify if the service is running correctly.

#### Start Front-end Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3011`.

Open your browser to access the application.
