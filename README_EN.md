## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this dilemma: the presentation is due tomorrow, but your slides are still completely blank; you have countless brilliant ideas in your head, but all your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design?

We yearn to quickly create presentations that are both professional and visually appealing. Although traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ You can only choose from preset templates, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult to carry out.
- 3️⃣ The final products look very similar, resulting in severe homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Low asset quality and a lack of relevance.
- 5️⃣ Fragmented text-image layouts and a poor design aesthetic.

These shortcomings make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two core requirements: speed and aesthetics. Even if they claim to be "Vibe PPT," they are still far from being truly "Vibe" in my eyes.

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has turned things around. I tried using 🍌pro to generate slide pages and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. Additionally, it could render almost all the text requested in the prompt with high precision while faithfully following the style of the reference image. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero barrier to entry, no design experience required, reducing the hassle of choosing templates
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and graphic elements to quickly gain design inspiration
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness
4. **Students**: Quickly complete assignment presentations, focusing energy on content rather than layout and beautification
5. **Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions, with rapid adaptation to multiple scenarios

<p>
  <b>🎯Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly create beautiful and professional presentations</b>
</p>

> LazyLLM also exposes `lazyllm install online-advanced`, but the PyPI wheel may not publish that group as a standard install extra, so Docker/prebuilt images rely on these explicit dependencies instead.
>
> Desktop (PyInstaller) builds register every LazyLLM online vendor explicitly

**Use the new editable export configuration method to get better editable export results**: You need to obtain the API KEY from the [Baidu AI Cloud Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/iam/#/iam/apikey/list) (click here to access) and fill it in the `BAIDU_API_KEY` field of the `.env` file (there is a generous free usage quota). For details, please refer to the instructions in https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121.


<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (For GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models via a GCP service account, and new users can use promotional credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the key file in JSON format.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml`, mount the key file into the container, and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

2. **Start Services**

**⚡ Using Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synchronized with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip the local build steps and achieve rapid deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Images (No Need to Build from Scratch)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After startup, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** in the app. The app will determine if there is an update available based on the current version SHA; when running from source code, the current Git SHA will also be used for determination.

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file, and then run the startup command again:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following lines in the .env file to use mirror sources in China
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/

docker logs --tail 100 banana-slides-frontend
```

5. **Stop Services**

```bash
docker compose down
```

6. **Update Project**

**Using pre-built images (docker-compose.prod.yml)**

You can also go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application first to see if a new version is available.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Using local build (docker-compose.yml)**

Note: If you have manually modified the code, this method does not apply. You need to revert the code to the pulled version first.

```bash
git pull 
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Deploy from Source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for explanation video export, and must include support for `libass` / `ass` subtitle filters
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when uploading PPTX files using the "PPT Refurbish" feature to convert PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading**, because LibreOffice rendering on the server side may cause layout issues due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore some special effects. Uploading PDF files directly does not require LibreOffice. Docker users who still need to support PPTX upload within the container can execute:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost after container reconstruction and must be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run the following command in the project root directory:
```bash

# macOS (Homebrew)

brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full

# Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9

# Then install the Python dependencies

```markdown
uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure environment variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

# Then, follow the aforementioned method to open and edit the `.env` file to configure your API key

```
```

#### Frontend Installation

1. **Enter the frontend directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure API address**

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service specified by `BACKEND_PORT` via Vite proxy (default `http://localhost:5011`). To modify this, please set `BACKEND_PORT` in the `.env` file in the project root directory.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important data locally, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`
> Note: Under default configuration, templates, assets, and outputs are all in the uploads/ folder

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5011`.

Access `http://localhost:5011/health` to verify if the service is running properly.

#### Start the Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3011`.

Open your browser to access the application.
