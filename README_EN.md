  * Fixes & Experience Optimizations
    * Fixed export-related 500 errors, reference file association timing, outline/page data misalignment, incorrect project task polling, infinite polling in description generation, image preview memory leaks, and partial failure handling in bulk deletion.
    * Optimized format example prompts, HTTP error message copy, Modal closing experience, cleaned up legacy project localStorage, and removed redundant prompts during initial project creation.
    * Several other optimizations and fixes.

## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: the presentation is due tomorrow, yet the slides remain blank; your mind is brimming with brilliant ideas, but your passion is drained by the tediousness of layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and aesthetically pleasing. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for speed, they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Only preset templates are available, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom makes multi-round revisions difficult.
- 3️⃣ Final products look similar, suffering from serious homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack relevance and specificity.
- 5️⃣ Fragmented text-image layouts with a poor sense of design.

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our needs for both "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, far from having enough "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana 🍌 model has brought a turning point. I experimented with 🍌 pro for PPT slide generation and found the results to be exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It accurately renders almost all text required by the prompts while strictly following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌 pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero threshold and no design experience, reducing the hassle of choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Refer to AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and graphic elements to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete assignment presentations, focusing energy on content rather than layout and beautification.
5. **Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions with quick adaptation for multiple scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly create beautiful and professional presentations</b>
</p>

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Flexible and Diverse Creative Paths

Supports three starting methods—**Ideas**, **Outlines**, and **Page Descriptions**—to accommodate different creative habits.
- **One-Sentence Generation**: Enter a topic, and the AI automatically generates a well-structured outline and page-by-page content descriptions.
- **Natural Language Editing**: Supports modifying outlines or descriptions using natural language via Vibe (e.g., "Change the third page to a case study"), with the AI adjusting in real-time.
- **Outline/Description Mode**: Supports both one-click batch generation and manual fine-tuning of details.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fc1ecc6-433d-4157-b4ca-95fcebac66ba" />

### 2. Powerful Asset Parsing Capabilities

- **Multi-format Support**: Upload PDF, Docx, MD, Txt, and other files for automatic background content parsing.
- **Smart Extraction**: Automatically identifies key points, image links, and chart information within the text, providing rich material for generation.
- **Automatic Image Archiving**: Images extracted from documents are automatically added to the project asset library once the reference file is associated with the project, enabling direct reuse later.
- **Style Reference**: Supports uploading reference images or templates to customize the PPT style.

### 3. "Vibe-style" Natural Language Modification

No longer restricted by complex menus; issue modification commands directly using **natural language**.
- **Partial Redrawing**: Make verbal-style modifications to unsatisfactory areas (e.g., "Change this chart to a pie chart").
- **Full-page Optimization**: Generate high-definition, stylistically consistent pages based on nano banana pro🍌.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/929ba24a-996c-4f6d-9ec6-818be6b08ea3" />

### 4. Out-of-the-box Format Export

- **Multi-format Support**: One-click export to standard **PPTX** or **PDF** files.
- **Playback Settings**: Enable slide transition animations before exporting to PPTX. Supports classic effects such as Fade, Push, Wipe, Split, Blinds, Checkerboard, and Clock, with support for multi-selection and random application.
- **Export Management**: The preview page lists files already exported on the server, allowing you to directly download or delete files no longer needed. Export task history is isolated by project, preventing accidental deletion of records from other projects.
- **Perfect Fit**: Default 16:9 aspect ratio; the layout requires no further adjustment and is ready for immediate presentation.

   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If using Docker for deployment, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml` to mount the key file into the container and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`

</details>

2. **Start Services**

**⚡ Use Prebuilt Images (Recommended)**

The project provides prebuilt frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip local build steps for rapid deployment:

```bash

# Launch using Pre-built Images (No need to build from scratch)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After starting, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application. The application will determine if there is an available update based on the current version SHA; when running from source code, the current Git SHA will also be used for determination.

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```

3. **Access the Application**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3011
- Backend API: http://localhost:5011

4. **View Logs**

```bash

# View Backend Logs (Last 200 Lines)

docker logs --tail 200 banana-slides-backend

# View Backend Logs in Real-time (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs -f --tail 100 banana-slides-backend

# View Frontend Logs (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs --tail 100 banana-slides-frontend
```

5. **Stop Services**

```bash
docker compose down
```

6. **Update Project**

**Using pre-built images (docker-compose.prod.yml)**

You can also go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the app to see if a new version is already available.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Using local build (docker-compose.yml)**

Note: If you have manually modified the code, this method is not applicable. You need to revert the code to the original version before pulling.

```bash
git pull 
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Deploy from Source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for exporting explanation videos, and must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when uploading PPTX files using the "PPT Revamp" feature to convert PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading.** Reason: Server-side rendering with LibreOffice may lead to layout misalignment due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore some special effects. LibreOffice is not required if uploading PDF files directly. Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container can execute:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost after the container is rebuilt and must be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run the following in the project root directory:
```bash

# macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full
```

# Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9

# Then install Python dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

# Then, follow the aforementioned method to open and edit the `.env` file to configure your API key.

# FastAPI Best Practices

## Introduction
This is a project on how to write efficient FastAPI code.

- **Fast**: High performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go**.
- **Efficient**: Greatly increases development speed.

## Quick Start
```bash
pip install fastapi
```

## Features
* **Auto-generated Docs**: Swagger and ReDoc.
* **Type Safety**: Based on Python type hints.

#### Frontend Installation

1. **Enter the frontend directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure API address**

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service specified by `BACKEND_PORT` via Vite proxy (default `http://localhost:5011`). To modify this, please set `BACKEND_PORT` in the `.env` file at the project root.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`
> Note: Under the default configuration, templates, assets, and outputs are all stored in the `uploads/` folder.

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5011`.

Visit `http://localhost:5011/health` to verify that the service is running correctly.

#### Start the Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3011`.

Open your browser to access the application.
